# Numerical_Math_Functions
Some of the functions I wrote in the various languages I use for computational mathematics. 

The large majority of the functions are comprised in the single Julia file MyMath.jl.
I decided to make this file in order to accomodate my needs while using Julia.
It contains simple yet powerful functions I would use for my coursework, as well as my personal research and interest.
I applied my own variations on some of the mechanics/equations in order to try and optimize the results.

At the end of the day, creating these functions is great practice, and moves me closer to my goal of having a personlized Julia
library for my work.
