Some functions I wrote purely for the practice of writing them.

**BigInt.py** Simulates "pen and paper" math by storing individual digits of a numbers in arrays. Has two functions. One for addition, and one for multiplication.The multiplication function simply calls the addition function over and over while updating the arrays.

**Continued_Fract_sqrt.jl:** Uses continued fractions to return the square root of a number. Perfectly accurate (error of 0 or 1e-15), and instantaneous in computation. Even up to large integers.

**PrimeConfirm.h:** Returns if the given number is a prime number or not. Instant return even for large integers.

**areaOfCircle.java:** Calculates the area of the circle, without the use of PI. Instead, uses an estimation based on a number of  triangles approaching infinitely small areas. Accurate to a percent error of 0.04
