```jldoctest
distime(Initial_Value,A,perB,C,perD,*Dpow,*Tpow)
```
This function will do a simple conversion for Distances over Time. **Example:** meters per second, to miles per hour. Keyword arugments Dpow and Tpow are set to 1 initially.
They stand for the power to which your units are being raised to **(feet per second SQUARED, or meters CUBED, for instance)**\n
Here is a list of input this function takes for Distances and Time respectively.\n
**Distance:** Millimeters = `"mm"` 	Centimeters = `"cm"` 	Decimeters = `"dm"` 	Meters = `"m"` 	Kilometers = `"km"`
              \nInches = `"inch"` 		Feet = `"ft"` 		Yards = `"yard"` 		Miles = `"mile"`\n
**Time:**     Seconds = `"sec"`		Minutes = `"min"` 	Hours = `"hour"` 		Days = `"day"`\n
# Example for converting 5 meters per second squared, to miles per hour squared
```jldoctest
julia> Dist_Conversion = distime(5,"m","sec","mile","hour",Tpow=2)
       print(Dist_Conversion)
       40264.95
